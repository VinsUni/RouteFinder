Route description

   
 U.S. 
Route 6 inEmery County, Utah  
US-6 enters Utahoverlapped  with 
US-50  in the Great Basin 
, a large desert 
 that includes much of western Utah. As 
part of theBasin and Range Province 
, the terrain alternates 
between north–south oriented flat valleys and mountain ranges. US-6 and US-50 
cross theSnake Valley , 
Confusion Range  (through Kings 
Canyon ), Tule Valley 
, House Range 
 (via Skull Rock Pass 

), andPahvant Valley 

 (passing north ofSevier Lake ), 
finally reaching the town ofHinckley 
 just before they split inDelta . US-6 
turns to the northeast at that city, paralleling theUnion Pacific Railroad 
's Lynndyl Subdivision 
 to the west of the Canyon 
Mountains , Gilson Mountains 
, and East Tintic Mountains 
—three ranges that form the 
eastern boundary of the Basin and Range Province. 


At Tintic Junction , the 
intersection withSR-36  in the Tintic 
Valley 

, US-6 turns east and ascends the East Tintic Mountains. It passes through the 
mining city ofEureka  as it climbs to 
The Summit 

, before descending throughHomansville Canyon 

 into theGoshen Valley . Although 
it left behind the UP rail line at Tintic Junction, this part of US-6 parallels 
the formerTintic Branch 
 
of theDenver and Rio Grande Western Railroad 
, which 
has been partially abandoned. After passing throughGoshen 
, the highway curves around the north 
side ofWarm Springs Mountain 

 and into theUtah Valley , where it 
entersSantaquin . On the east side 
of that city, US-6 begins an overlap withI-15 
, while the old alignment—SR-198 
—continues straight through Payson 
 and Salem 
. After about 13 miles (21 km) together 
in the Utah Valley, US-6 and I-15 separate inSpanish Fork 
, the latter turning southeast 
onto a short two-laneexpressway 
. SR-198 rejoins US-6 on the 
eastern outskirts of Spanish Fork, and soon thereafterUS-89 
 joins at Moark Junction 
. The two routes—US-6 and 
US-89—begin an overlap here that extends through theSpanish Fork Canyon 

, alongside the UPProvo Subdivision 
 (ex-D&RGW 
), to Thistle 
 in the Wasatch Range 
. The remainder of US-6 to the 
Colorado state line parallels this rail line (which becomes theGreen River 
Subdivision  at Helper 
). 


US-6 continues alone through the Spanish Fork Canyon, now alongside Soldier 
Creek 

, toSoldier Summit  on the 
Wasatch Plateau , where it 
finally leaves the Great Basin into thewatershed 
 of the Colorado River 
. It begins to descend by 
following theWhite River 

, which empties into thePrice River  
nearColton . The Price River takes 
US-6 down through thePrice Canyon , 
the west edge of theBook Cliffs , 
joiningUS-191  at Castle Gate 
. The land flattens and opens out 
atHelper , named for the helper 
locomotives  needed to carry 
trains up to Soldier Summit, and US-6 continues southeasterly aroundPrice 
 on a two-lane freeway 
 bypass, with the old alignment 
marked as both abusiness route  and
SR-55 . Relatively flat land continues 
as US-6 parallels the Book Cliffs to the southwest and west, crossing the Price 
River atWoodside . West of Green 
River , US-6 joins I-70 
/US-50 
, which it overlaps for the remainder 
of its stay in Utah. Now south of the Book Cliffs, the four routes head east to
Crescent Junction , where 
US-191 splits to the south. As it begins to approach the Colorado River, the 
highway curves northeasterly through theGrand Valley 
 and into Colorado. 


According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
, 
there were 519 fatal and serious injury crashes between Spanish Fork and Green 
River in Utah from 1996–2008, leading the stretch to be considered one of the 
deadliest roads in the U.S. 


  This section 
requiresexpansion 
. 
(July 2008) US-6 forms an arch-shaped route with Spanish Fork 
 at the apex 
. The western half of the arch is 
the road less traveled, passing through theGreat Basin 
 desert 
, Sevier Lake 
, Delta 
, Eureka 
 and the Tintic Standard Reduction 
Mill .

The eastern half is a popular transportation corridor, paralleling the Denver 
and Rio Grande Western Railroad 
's 
transcontinental line. This half passes overSoldier Summit 
 and the historic railroad 
 hub of Helper 
.

Starting in the spring of 1983, US-6 was a discontinuous route for almost one 
year, due to a massive landslide that destroyed the town ofThistle 
. During this time traffic was 
routed on two detours. One, viaSalina, Utah 
, was over 200 miles (320 km) long 
and took traffic almost 100 aerial miles from the route of US-6. The other, via
Duchesne, Utah , was shorter. 
However, this detour traversed steep grades and was not recommended for trucks. 
The night before the rebuilt US-6 opened, the highway stubs at either side of 
the landslide were filled with tens of miles of trucks, the drivers tired of 
the lost revenue from the long detours. The landslide remains the most costly 
in the history of the United States. 
 Two rest areas 
 along US-6 pay tribute to the 
residents of the town who lost everything.

Utah passes through or by severalghost towns 
 including Tintic 
, 
Thistle , Tucker 
, Soldier Summit 
, Colton 
, Woodside 
 and Cisco 
. Most of these towns were either 
mining  or railroad based.

The 120 miles (190 km) section of US-6 between Spanish Fork and Price is 
considered one of the deadliest stretches of highway in the United States. A 
high volume of trucks and automobiles travel that stretch at interstate speeds, 
along hairpin turns, through narrow canyons.
