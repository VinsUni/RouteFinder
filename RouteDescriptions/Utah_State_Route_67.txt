Route description

The freeway begins at a partial interchange at I-215 
, allowing northbound motorists from 
the interstate to transfer onto Legacy Parkway and vice-versa. From the 
interchange, the highway heads northerly with two lanes in each direction 
through semi-rural westernDavis County 
 before turning northeasterly 
and north again, intersecting with 500 South at adiamond interchange 
, which also provides a 
connection to Redwood Road (SR-68 ). 
The freeway continues north before beginning a curve to the northeast inWest 
Bountiful . Before reverting 
to its original northerly direction, the route intersects Parrish Lane (SR-105 
) at another diamond interchange. 
Past the intersection, the freeway parallelsI-15 
 with Union Pacific 
 and Utah Transit Authority 
 (FrontRunner 
) railroad track in between. The 
highway, enteringFarmington , 
gains one lane in each direction and terminates at a dual junction with I-15 and
US-89 . 


After a lawsuit that halted construction of the parkway over environmental 
concerns, the design of the road was re-envisioned to include extensive wetland 
protection west of the freeway and in the freeway median, a trail system along 
the side of the freeway, and numerous pedestrian overpasses and underpasses for 
ease of access to the trail system. Many of the architectural features were 
also specially-designed to give the freeway a more unique feel. 


The Utah Department of Transportation 
 has designated 
the route as State Route 67 and has signed the route with SR-67 shields.
