Route description

The route begins in the Heber Valley - part of the Wasatch Back 
 - at the intersection of Main 
Street and Center Street in the city ofMidway 
 
 and 
heads west along Main Street through from the center of town through shops and 
homes. 
 
After two blocks, the route turns north on 200 West Street and turns west again 
two blocks later onto 200 North street. 
 After 
travelling west for 0.6 miles (0.97Â km) through residential communities, the 
route turns again to the north along Homestead Drive, passing by the Homestead 
Resort,Homestead caldera  and 
the Utah Golf Resort and leaving the city limits. Just outside of Midway, 
Homestead Drive curves to the west at the entrance ofWasatch Mountain State Park
 . At this point, 
State Route 222 turns right onto Warm Springs Road to continue north, taking a 
jog to the east to skirt the east edge of the golf course on the state park 
(staying on Homestead westward is the route of formerSR-220 

). As it passes the golf course, the route merges with Pine Canyon Road and 
resumes its northward direction, passing the Wasatch Mountain State Park 
Campground as it begins to climb out of the valley and follow Pine Creek into 
the foothills of the easternWasatch Range 
. Just after passing the 
campgrounds, the route ends at the pavement change coincident with a gate. 

 The remainder of the road, which is closed in the winter and not designated as 
part of the state route, continues north overGuardsman Pass 

 to meet with other roads that provide access toPark City 
 in Summit County 
 via SR-224
