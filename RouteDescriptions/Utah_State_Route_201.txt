Route description

   
 The intersection of 
SR-201,I-15 , and I-80 
, locally known as the "Spaghetti Bowl" 
At its western terminus, SR-201 begins at a partial interchange atI-80 
. Heading generally east 
with two lanes in each direction, the expressway passes by theKennecott 
 Smokestack 
, the tallest structure in 
Utah.  
 Past its 
intersection atSR-202 , the route 
takes a turn to the southeast, bypassing the Kennecotttailings pond 
. 
 Now exiting 
Kennecott property, the route exits unpopulated terrain and enters the urban
Wasatch Front , beginning with the 
Salt Lake City  suburb of Magna 
. Past junctions at 9200 West, 8400 
West, 8000 West and 7200 West, the route veers northerly three blocks and 
becomes a limited-access freeway. 
 East of 
7200 West, SR-201 is routed at approximately 2100 South in Salt Lake County's 
grid system, giving the freeway its nickname of "21st South Freeway". 


Now with three lanes in each direction, the highway straddles the boundary 
between Salt Lake City andWest Valley City 
, another suburb of the 
former. The road continues due east withdiamond interchanges 
 at 5600 West (SR-172 
) and Bangerter Highway (SR-154 
). Immediately following a 
single-point urban interchange 
 (SPUI) at 3200 
West, the freeway intersectsI-215 
 in the form of a 
cloverleaf interchange . 
The road dips to the south slightly and, following two SPUIs at Redwood Road (
SR-68 ) and 900 West, the freeway 
terminates at the Spaghetti Bowl interchange, giving eastbound motorists on 
SR-201 the option of continuing toI-15 ,
I-80 , 1300 South and 900 South. 
However, an eastbound traveler wanting to continue on the surface portion of 
SR-201 to State Street must exit on 900 West, head north briefly and then turn 
eastbound on 2100 South; a westbound traveler on 2100 South wishing to connect 
to the freeway must take an on-ramp from the surface street just before 900 
West. Prior to 1997, this connection was direct. 
 Now on 
the four-lane 2100 South, a secondary surface street, the route runs along the 
Salt Lake Cityâ€“South Salt Lake 
 border. State maintenance 
of 2100 South ends at the intersection of State Street (US-89 
).
