Route description

SR-52 begins at SR-114  in western 
Orem , across from the former Geneva 
Steel Plant , which was on the 
shore ofUtah Lake . For its entire 
length, SR-52 gradually ascends through theUtah Valley 
 along 800 North, ending at US-189 
 where the valley gives way to the 
Wasatch Range  and that highway 
entersProvo Canyon . 
 A mid-1980s 
flyover  takes traffic 
directly from SR-52 onto US-189 north in the canyon. 


SR-52 is in the National Highway System 
 as a connection 
between I-15 and US-189. 
 A project to 
widen about half the length of the road through Orem from four to six lanes was 
completed in October 2008.
