Route description

This short highway is mainly used as a cutoff for local Snake Valley 
 residents between Garrison 
(and SR-21) and the main road in the valley, US 6/50. Motorists traveling from 
the south to the east, and vice versa, use the SR-159 cutoff. The road does 
"continue" north of US 6/50 as a dirt road, known commonly as the "Gandy Road." 
This road travels up Snake Valley towardGandy 
, Callao 
, and eventually to Wendover 
.
