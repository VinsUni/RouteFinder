Route description

The road begins at a diamond interchange 
 with I-15 
 at exit 207. From that point, the 
route heads northwest as a two-lane undivided highway, running almost parallel 
to I-15 in the west and Chicken Creek Reservoir in the east. Once the route 
passes the reservoir, it eventually turns north-northwesterly until reaching 
the intersection of a local road, where it turns east. The route enters Levan 
as 100 North and soon terminates atSR-28 
, the main street of Levan.
