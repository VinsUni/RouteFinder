 White cliffs 
and forest on the way up Parowan Canyon State Route 143 begins at Interstate 15 
 in Iron County 
 just west of Parowan 
 as 200 South and travels through 
the center of town before turning south intoParowan Canyon 

. 
 From here, the route climbs past theVermillion Cliffs 
, 

 named for their reddish color produced byiron oxides 
. 

 Farther up the canyon, the highway passes by theWhite Cliffs 
 as it enters Dixie National 
Forest , and begins a steep 
climb up toBrian Head . With the 
grade  reaching 13% in places, 
precipitous enough that travel byRVs 
 or semi trucks 
 is not recommended. 


As the route climbs onto the Markagunt Plateau 
 at an elevation of nearly 
10,000 feet (3,000 m), it enters the town of Brian Head, Utah's highest 
incorporated city and the home of Utah's highest ski resort,Brian Head Ski 
Resort . 

 From the top of this plateau, vistas open up allowing for views of over 100 
miles (160 km) in every direction. 

 The area is populated withEngelman spruces 
, aspens 
, and alpine meadows 
 full of wildflowers 
. SR-143 continues climbing southward, 
passing the northern edge ofCedar Breaks National Monument 
, a natural 
amphitheater  canyon 
 eroded out of the western edge of the 
plateau similarly toBryce Canyon .
 

 Here, the route reaches its highest point at 10,626 feet (3,239 m) above sea 
level, the second-highest paved road in Utah behind theMirror Lake Highway 
 at 10,715 feet (3,266 m). 
 
The route turns to the east here, while continuing south leads to the rest of 
Cedar Breaks National Monument andState Route 148 
 (the Cedar Breaks Scenic
