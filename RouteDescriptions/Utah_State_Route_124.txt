Route description

State Route 124 begins near Horse Canyon Mine along the Book Cliffs 
 in northern Emery County. It starts 
out traveling west, but soon curves to the north as it crosses the county line 
into Carbon County. The route continues north along the base of the Book 
Cliffs, through Columbia Junction just west of Columbia, and finally takes a 
jog to the west just before ending at its intersection with SR-123 in East 
Carbon.
