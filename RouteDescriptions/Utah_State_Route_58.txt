 US 93 Alt. turns south towardsEly , 
while BL-80 continues east until it reaches theMontego Bay Resort 
 and Wendover Nugget

 The casinos are connected via asky bridge 
 that allows pedestrian access between the hotels without crossing the highway.[

 BL-80 in 
Wendover, Utah looking west BL-80 continues to the east past Aria Boulevard, 
which to the north connects to I-80, and to the south leads to the historic
Wendover Air Force Base , 
where theEnola Gay  was stationed. 
 
The highway briefly parallels theShafter Subdivision 
 of the Union Pacific Railroad
 's Central Corridor 
, 
 
 
which was formerly part of theFeather River Route 
 of the Western Pacific 
Railroad . 
 As the 
highway travels east towards ahalf trumpet interchange 
 with 
I-80, the number of lanes drops from five to two. Traffic from BL-80 can access 
eastbound I-80 or turn off onto Frontage Road; however, to access westbound 
I-80, travelers must continue eastbound until the next exit and turn around. 
Traffic into Wendover can access BL-80 from both directions of I-80, and from 
Frontage Road. 


The Utah segment of BL-80 is codified into Utah law as Utah Code §72-4-111.[12
]  Every 
year, the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) conducts a series of surveys 
on its highways to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms ofaverage 
annual daily traffic 
 (AADT), which is a measure of average traffic volume for any day of the year. 
In 2009, UDOT calculated that 2,370 cars traveled on BL-80 at the state line.[13
]  
This is a significant decrease from the traffic counts earlier in the decade, 
which measured 11,205 cars in 2006, 10,345 cars in 2005, and 13,840 cars in 
2004. 
 
Twenty-one percent of this traffic consists of trucks.
