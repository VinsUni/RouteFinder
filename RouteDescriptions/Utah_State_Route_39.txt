Route description

The route begins heading east from the intersection at 4700 West (SR-134 
) as a two-lane highway in a 
relatively rural part ofWeber County 
. By the junction of 1900 West 
(SR-126 ) in a more urban 
portion of the county, the route is widened to five lanes. The highway variates 
in direction after Monroe Boulevard, veering to the southeast.

Once exiting Ogden , the route 
becomes more curved as it traversesOgden Canyon 
 on a two-lane road, still 
maintaining a general east-northeasterly direction. TheOgden River 
 runs parallel to the highway during 
its tenure in Ogden Canyon. This portion of the route is named Ogden River 
Scenic Byway. As it enters the Ogden Valley,SR-158 
 splits off to the north, crossing 
Pineview Dam , while SR-39 continues 
to the east, along the southern edge ofPineview Reservoir 
. Right before entering 
Huntsville , the route turns 
north and becomes 7800 East. The route turns east and maintains an initial 
north-northeasterly direction before eventually turning northeast. It traverses 
scenic, remote areas of theWasatch Range 
 and this portion between 
Huntsville and Woodruff is closed during winter. The route terminates on Main 
Street (SR-16 ) in Woodruff 
.
