Route description

SR-181 began at the modern border of Murray and Holladay at the intersection 
ofSR-152  and 1300 East and headed 
north on the latter on a two-lane undivided highway, as it was for most of the 
route (The portion of 1300 East south of SR-152, which was never state 
maintained, is actually much wider than most of SR-181). In the route's first 
two miles (mostly within modernMillcreek Township 
), a small military logistics 
facility and St. Mark's Hospital were located on the west side, the latter at 
the junction with 3900 South. Further north, SR-181 crossed overMill Creek 

 and then immediately climbed a steep hill to cross theJordan and Salt Lake 
Canal 

 just before intersectingSR-171  
(3300 South) and enteringSalt Lake City 
. From this point on, the route 
ran along the top of the nearly-continuousescarpment 
 dividing the East Bench of the Salt 
Lake Valley 

 from lower-lying land to the west; the escarpment coincidentally runs almost 
perfectly north-to-south.

The highway expanded to four lanes past SR-171 and veered northwesterly 
through a major commercial area, therefore going slightly out of the alignment 
of 1300 East in theSalt Lake County 
 grid system and becoming 
Richmond Street through southernHighland Park 
. This was 
brief, however, and it returned back to 1300 East on the grid alignment past 
Highland Drive and reverted back to its original direction in northern Highland 
Park. At Highland Drive, the highway widened to six lanes (plus, for the first 
time, frontage roads on the west side). SR-181 continued north to intersectI-80 
, Parley's Creek 

 (withParley's Trail 

, still under construction as of 2012), and 2100 South inSugar House 
 (next to Sugar House 
Park, the formerSugar House Prison 
), where it lost four 
of its six lanes. This stretch of road, from 2100 South north to 1300 South, 
was frequently congested. 
 After the 
crossing ofEmigration Creek 

,Westminster College 
 and the 
Frank M. and Susan E. Ulmer House 

 were located on the west side of the road on this segment, while theWasatch 
Hollow 

 neighborhood was on the east side. The route gained a lane in the southbound 
section past 1300 South and another lane in the northbound section by 900 
South, but these extra lanes have been removed in favor ofbicycle lanes 
, center turn lanes, and extra 
parking since Salt Lake City took ownership of the road. Beyond 900 South, the 
road passed east ofEast High School 
. It 
continued in this matter to its terminus atSR-186 
, near the University of Utah 
 and west of the Rice-Eccles 
Stadium .
