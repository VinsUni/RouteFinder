Route description

SR-79 begins at an intersection of SR-126 on the western boundary of Ogden. 
The highway heads northeast on four lanes of Hinckley Drive divided by a center 
median, straddling the northern periphery ofOgden-Hinckley Airport 
. Before intersecting 1325 
West the road loses division of its lanes. Passing the intersection of 
Pennsylvania Avenue the road turns east, gains a lane in each direction and 
intersects at a diamond interchange withI-15 
. Past Parker Drive the road again 
briefly turns northeast and climbs onto a viaduct over railroad tracks. The 
termination of the viaduct begins the one-way pair of SR-79, with 30th Street 
forming the westbound segment and 31st Street the eastbound segment. The pair 
continues for 0.5 miles (0.80Â km) until reaching Washington Boulevard (US-89 
, where 31st Street loses state 
maintenance and SR-79 continues on 30th Street, now a two-way street. The 
two-lane highway continues east until reaching Harrison Boulevard (SR-203), 
where SR-79 ends.
