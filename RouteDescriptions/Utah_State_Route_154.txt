Route description

State Route 154 (Bangerter Highway) begins just southeast of a single-point 
urban interchange  
atI-15  at the intersection of 13800 
South in theSalt Lake City  suburb 
ofDraper . The three-lane road 
curves from the north to the west and widens to four lanes before accessing the 
I-15 interchange. Past the freeway exit, SR-154 expands to three lanes in each 
direction with a median barrier in the center. With the exception of two 
variations in the course of the road prior to an intersection at Redwood Road (
SR-68 ), the highway heads relatively 
due west (there is a dip to the south for about a mile as the roadway crosses 
theJordan River ). Throughout 
its whole route, with four exceptions (I-15, SR-48, SR-201, and I-80), SR-154 
intersects only major cross streets at grade-level intersections. The route 
runs into the boundary ofBluffdale 
 and Riverton 
 before definitively entering 
Riverton boundaries when the highway makes a northerly curve.

   
 Bangerter 
Highway westbound at Redwood Road (SR-68 
) Making a slight easterly jog in the 
process, the road maintains its six-lane divided-highway setup as it intersects 
13400 South, 12600 South (SR-71 ) and 
11400 South (SR-175  and the access 
road toDaybreak  and the 
Oquirrh Mountain LDS Temple 
). Arriving in South 
Jordan , more cross streets 
intersect Bangerter Highway (South Jordan ParkwaySR-151 
, 9800 South and 9000 South) before 
the route traverses intoWest Jordan 
. There is no at-grade 
intersection at 7800 SouthSR-48 , but 
an overpass with on- and off- ramps, permitting easy access toSouth Valley 
Regional Airport  
and allowing uninterrupted traffic flow on Bangerter. More intersections are 
offered at 7000 South (access toJordan Landing 
) and Bennion Boulevard (6200 
South). The route slides to the west, enteringTaylorsville 
 and crossing 5400 South (
SR-173 ) and 4700 South.

Now into West Valley City 
, 4100 South, 3500 South (
SR-171 ), and 3100 South are afforded 
access to Bangerter Highway. The highway curves northwest, intersecting with 
Parkway Boulevard (2700 South), Lake Park Boulevard (2400 South), and 2100 
South before meetingSR-201  (21st 
South Freeway) at adiverging diamond interchange 
 and entering Salt 
Lake City . Losing one lane in 
each direction, the route meanders northerly toward theAirport 
, crossing 
1820 South and California Avenue (1300 South) before meeting at a cloverleaf 
interchange atI-80  and terminating at 
the access road to the Airport.
