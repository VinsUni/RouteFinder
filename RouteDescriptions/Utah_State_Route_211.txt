Route description

The highway begins near Church Rock 
, a notable rock formation 
alongU.S. Route 191  between
Moab  and Monticello 
. It runs past the ruins of the 
utopian  religious community called Home 
of Truth , and through 
Photograph Gap. The highway then descends Indian Canyon. Once exiting the 
canyon the highway passes by Newspaper Rock, directly off the shoulder of the 
highway. The highway also passes by Six-Shooter Peak, a notable peak near the 
entrance to Canyonlands National Park. The highway ends at Dugout Ranch just 
shy of the National Park boundary.

The descent down Indian Canyon between US-191 and Newspaper Rock features a 
steep descent and sharp curves. As a result, the Utah Department of 
Transportation mandates that all vehicles using Route 211 that exceed 10 feet 
(3.0 m) in width or 80 feet (24 m) in length have an accompanying pilot car 
escort
