Route description

[edit 

] Arizona border to I-70

US-89 enters Utah from the south inside the Glen Canyon National Recreation 
Area , about 
7 miles (11 km) north of theGlen Canyon Dam 
, where it crosses the Colorado 
River  near Page, Arizona 
. After leaving the recreation area 
and passing the small town ofBig Water 
, the highway curves west through 
theGrand Staircase-Escalante National Monument 
. 
US-89 stays near the monument's southern boundary, 
 crossing the 
East Clark Bench 

 andThe Cockscomb 
 
and passing south of theVermilion Cliffs 
 of the Grand Staircase 
. At the city of Kanab 
, US-89 meets the north end of US-89A 
, an alternate route 
 south into Arizona, and abruptly 
turns north and begins climbing the staircase. Here the Mount Carmel Scenic 
Byway begins; one of theUtah Scenic Byways 
, it stretches north to SR-12 
 at Bryce Canyon Junction 
. 
 The 
Vermilion Cliffs are ascended via the canyon carved byKanab Creek 
. Near the White Cliffs 
, US-89 meets SR-9 
 at Mt. Carmel Junction 
, where travelers can 
turn to reachZion National Park 
. The final "step" is the Pink 
Cliffs , where the highway follows 
alongside theVirgin River  to the 
highest point on US-89 in southern Utah and the east end ofSR-14 
, a summit at Long Valley Junction 
 (elevation 
 7450 feet/2300 m). 


   
 Looking south from 
Sevier  towards the Sevier Canyon 
 North from Long Valley Junction, 
US-89 descends through the valley of theSevier River 
, meeting SR-12 
, a scenic highway 
 that leads to Bryce Canyon 
National Park , at 
Bryce Canyon Junction 
,SR-143  in Panguitch 
, and SR-20 
 at Bear Valley Junction 
. As the highway 
continues north, the valley narrows significantly into theCircleville Canyon 

 before opening out near the town ofCircleville 
. In this part of the valley, 
the Sevier River isdammed  to create the 
Piute Reservoir 

, and US-89 meetsSR-62  near Kingston 
. North of Marysvale 
, the valley again narrows into the 
Sevier Canyon , which carries the 
river to its confluence withClear Creek 
 and US-89 to its overlap 
 with Interstate 70 
, beginning at Sevier 
. 


[edit 

] I-70 to the Wasatch Front

Although US-89 follows the I-70 freeway 
 from Sevier toSalina , the old 
alignment can still be driven, and is state-maintained north ofElsinore 
 as SR-258 
, SR-118 
 (which overlaps I-70 Business 
 through 
Richfield ), SR-24 
, and US-50 
. Both highways stay mainly in the 
west half of the Sevier River's valley, with the faster I-70/US-89 bypassing 
the communities that the surface road passes through. Just south ofSalina 
, I-70 curves to the east, rising 
alongsideSalina Creek 
, 
and US-89 exits into downtown Salina, where it rejoins its pre-freeway 
alignment.US-50  overlaps US-89 
between I-70 and Salina, following I-70 east and a separate alignment northwest 
from the area; the shortInterstate 70 Business 

 also uses this roadway as abusiness spur 
 from I-70 to the city. North of 
Salina, US-89 bypassesRedmond  (SR-256
  follows the former route through 
the town) and passes throughCenterfield 
 to Gunnison 
, where it meets SR-28 
 and finally turns away from the 
Sevier River. 


At Gunnison, US-89 turns east before curving northeast into the Sanpete Valley
 , formed by the San Pitch River 
, a tributary of the Sevier 
River. Along US-89 in this valley are several small cities:Manti 
, Ephraim 
, Mount Pleasant 
, and Fairview 
. Between Ephraim and Mount 
Pleasant, US-89 meets the south end ofSR-132 
 at Pigeon Hollow Junction 
. SR-132 was formerly
US-189 , connecting US-89 
withUS-91  in Nephi 
. Beyond Fairview, where the scenic 
SR-31  turns east, US-89 climbs out of 
the valley, reaching a summit atHill Top 

 (elevation 6400 feet/2000 m).Thistle Creek 
 
parallels the next leg of the highway, descending through a canyon to the 
junction withUS-6  near the ghost town 
 of Thistle 
, flooded by a landslide 
 in 1983. Thistle Creek and Soldier 
Creek 

, paralleled by US-89 and US-6, merge near this junction to formSpanish Fork 
, which the overlapped 
 routes follow northwest through 
Spanish Fork Canyon 

 into theUtah Valley  at Moark 
Junction . US-89 splits to 
the north from US-6 there, skirts the west edge ofMapleton 
, and merges with SR-51 
 - the old Arrowhead Trail 
 (US-91 
) - south of downtown Springville 
.

State Street  
approaching theUtah State Capitol 
; northbound US-89 turned left 
here until 2007 From Springville north to Salt Lake City 
, US-89 parallels—and for a 
distanceoverlaps —Interstate 15 
, following the old 
Arrowhead Trail, once the main highway from Salt Lake City toLos Angeles 
, through a number of downtowns. 
Numerous state highways connect US-89 to I-15, includingSR-77 
 in Springville 
, SR-114 
 in Provo 
, SR-52 
 in Orem 
, SR-180 
 and SR-145 
 in American Fork 
, and SR-73 
 in Lehi 
. In Provo, US-89 meets US-189 
, its only branch, which heads 
northeast throughProvo Canyon  to 
Heber City , connecting to I-80 
 and bypassing Salt Lake City. North of 
Lehi, US-89 merges with I-15 (at exit 282), which has been built on or near the 
old road through agap  in the 
Traverse Mountains  (elevation 
4800 feet/1500 m) into theSalt Lake Valley 
. The routes split in Draper 
, formerly with a direct interchange 
north ofSR-71 , but US-89 traffic must 
now exit at SR-71 (exit 291), turn east to Factory Outlet Drive, and follow this
frontage road  to the location of 
the former split. From here all the way todowntown Salt Lake City 
, US-89 is marked along 
State Street , a 
major north–south street that ends at theUtah State Capitol 
. After passing through Sandy 
, Midvale 
, Murray 
, Millcreek Township 
, and South Salt Lake 
, State Street enters Salt Lake 
City at the intersection withSR-201  
(2100 South).

Until 2007, US-89 followed State Street to North Temple 

 (100 North), two blocks from the capitol, but now it turns at 400 South, 
following the former alignment ofSR-186 
 and SR-176 
 west and north on 300 West, and 
rejoining its pre-2007 route at North Temple. In this area, modern US-89 runs 
for one block with theUTA TRAX Red Line 
 in its median before crossing 
the TRAX line inMain Street 
's median, 
then passing theFrank E. Moss United States Courthouse 
, Pioneer 
Park 

, the historicWarehouse District 

 at Pierpont Avenue,Japantown 

,EnergySolutions Arena , the
Arena TRAX station , the 
Triad Center , and West High School 
. As it leaves 
downtown, 300 West curves northwesterly and becomes Beck Street, meeting the 
modern terminus of SR-186 at Victory Road at the back side ofCapitol Hill 
.

[edit 

] Northern Wasatch Front

US-89 leaves Salt Lake City at exit 312 of I-15 
, where it acts as I-15's frontage roads
 . Just south of I-15's junction 
withI-215 , US-89 splits to the 
northeast, passing throughBountiful 
 andWoods Cross . A northerly 
curve onto 500 West removes the highway from Bountiful's Main Street, and it 
merges with I-15 at exit 317 to bypassCenterville 
 and Farmington 
, where the old road (former US-91 
, but never US-89) is SR-106 
, through the narrow strip of land 
that separatesFarmington Bay 

 from theWasatch Mountains . 
US-89 leaves I-15 at exit 324, where theLegacy Parkway 
 also ends, and proceeds north on a
freeway . This portion of US-89 is the 
only one to includeexit numbers  
based on its own mileage, as opposed to theoverlapping 
 I-15 or I-70. The freeway ends 
after US-89 crossesSR-273 , the 
former surface alignment of US-91 in both directions, and heads north as a 
four-lane road along the Wasatch foothills, to the east ofLayton 
 and Hill Air Force Base 
. After crossing I-84 
 in Uintah 
, US-89 enters Ogden 
, which it traverses via Washington 
Boulevard, rejoining old US-91 (nowSR-26 
) south of downtown. Beyond Ogden, 
US-89 continues in a general northerly direction along the thin strip between
Willard Bay  and the Wasatch 
Mountains toBrigham City , where 
it finally turns east away from the I-15 corridor.

] Wasatch Front to Idaho border

   
 US-89 through Logan 
Canyon , a National Scenic Byway 
 US-89 meets the current 
alignment ofUS-91  in the southern 
outskirts of Brigham City, turning east for an overlap on the city's southeast 
bypass. (SR-13  and SR-90 
 are the former alignment through 
Brigham City.) The two routes head east upBox Elder Canyon 
 in the southern Wellsville 
Mountains , finally leaving 
the valley of theGreat Salt Lake  
into a small valley that containsMantua Reservoir 

 (elevation 5200 feet/1585 m). US-89/US-91 turns north there, bypassing the 
town ofMantua  to the west, and 
continues to ascend through Dry Canyon toSardine Summit 

 (elevation 5900 feet/1798 m). Another small valley leads toWellsville Canyon 

, where the four-lane roadway again turns east and descends into theCache Valley
 . In that valley, US-89/US-91 heads 
northeast, bypassingWellsville  
to the east, into downtownLogan . 
US-91 continues northerly from Logan intoIdaho 
, but US-89 splits to the east, beginning a 
long climb of theBear River Range 
 through Logan Canyon 
. The Logan Canyon Scenic Byway, a 
Utah andNational Scenic Byway 
, begins at Logan and 
follows US-89 up the canyon, past the access road to theBeaver Mountain 
 ski area 
, to Garden City 
 and on to the state line. 
 
 Bear Lake Summit 

 (elevation 7800 ft/2377 m), at the top of the range, is the highest point on 
US-89 in Utah, from which it descends the east slope viahorseshoe curves 
 to Garden City 
 on the shore of Bear Lake 
 (elevation 5900 ft/1798 
m). The final segment of US-89 to theIdaho  
state line follows the lake's west shore, its location constrained by the Bear 
River Range just to the west.
