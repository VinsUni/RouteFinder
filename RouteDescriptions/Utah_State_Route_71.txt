Route description



 Riverton

The highway begins at the intersection of SR-154 
 (Bangerter Highway) and 12600 South 
inRiverton  and heads east on 
12600 South, a four-lane undivided highway. As the route continues east through 
suburban Riverton and intersects 1300 West, it gains a center median and turns 
northeast. The route passes a park and a golf course and crosses over theJordan 
River . The road straightens 
to the east and, moving north three blocks on theSalt Lake County 
 grid position, turns into 
12300 South.



 Draper

The highway enters Draper  and 
intersects with I-15 at exit 291, asingle-point urban interchange 
. Between this 
interchange and Factory Outlet Drive, a concurrency spanning 0.097 miles 
(0.156Â km) withUS-89  occurs. 
 The 
road continues east through Draper before turning north onto 700 East. Past 
Kimballs Lane, the road veers to the west slightly and crosses theUTA TRAX Blue 
Line 's Draper light rail 
extension at an acute angle, then straightens to its original northerly 
direction past 11400 South.



 Sandy

The route passes through Sandy  as 
a five-lane (including center turn lane) road with sidewalks along most of its 
length. A bridge spans Dimple Dell Park (Dry Creek 

) north of 10600 South. In this area, the road is next toWhite City 
, an unincorporated enclave of 
Sandy. The road intersects 9400 South (formerUtah State Route 209 
) in a retail area, then 
intersects 9000 South (current Utah State Route 209) at the southeast corner of 
theSandy Historic District 
.



 Midvale

SR-71 enters Midvale  at 7800 
South and curves northeast along the south bank of the East Jordan Canal, 
passingHillcrest High School 
 before crossing 
over the canal and turning north again (as 900 East) to run through the western 
part of theFort Union  
commercial district. Upon reachingInterstate 215 
, the road is joined by the Jordan and 
Salt Lake Canal, and the canal and road cross the freeway together on adjacent 
bridges, enteringMurray .



 Murray

Access to Interstate 215 from SR-71 is provided by Winchester Street, which 
connects to Exit 9 a short distance to the east.Wheeler Farm 
 appears east of SR-71 as the Jordan 
and Salt Lake Canal passes under the road and continues east in a pipe just 
north of Winchester Street. The route intersects the eastern segment of Vine 
Street (former State Route 173 
) just as it 
passes overLittle Cottonwood Creek 
, which is in a concrete 
trench; the western segment of Vine Street meets SR-71 at an unsignalized 
intersection a short distance further north. After passing a retail area and 
the entrance to a golf course, the road meets the north (non-state-maintained) 
segment of 900 East, the northern terminus ofSR-152 
 (Van Winkle Expressway), and 
Murray-Holladay Road (former State Route 174 
) at a six-way 
intersection south ofBig Cottonwood Creek 
. The complexity of this 
six-way intersection has been moderated by effectively dividing it into two 
three-way and one four-way intersection in close proximity: SR-71, in 
particular, turns west at the four-way intersection (from which 900 East 
continues north and SR-152 continues east) and then immediately intersects 
Murray-Holladay Road at a signalized three-way intersection (though 
northwest-bound traffic on SR-71 never has to stop, due to achannelized 
 free right turn 
 arrangement). Beyond this 
intersection, SR-71 (which now has four lanes in each direction, having 
absorbed much of SR-152's traffic) crosses Big Cottonwood Creek and forms the 
border between Murray andMillcreek Township 
 for a short distance as it 
curves north again to become 700 East and intersectState Route 266 
 (4500 South).



 Millcreek Township and South Salt Lake

The road continues straight north as 700 East through Millcreek Township 
, then, north of 3900 South, as 
the border between Millcreek Township andSouth Salt Lake 
 (it never fully enters South 
Salt Lake). It intersectsSR-171  
(3300 South) right after crossingMill Creek 
, then passes Nibley Golf 
Course before enteringSalt Lake City 
. Throughout this area (and 
continuing as far north asLiberty Park 
 in Salt Lake 
City), the road was widened to four or more vehicle lanes in each direction by 
acquisition (usingeminent domain ) 
and flattening of a large amount of property on the west side; as a result few 
structures (and even fewer old buildings) front onto the west side of the 
street, whereas the east side has many remaining old houses and even old street 
light poles.



 Salt Lake City

The highway continues north on 700 East in Salt Lake City 
 and intersects I-80 
 at exit 125, a diamond interchange 
. It crosses the Sugar House 
Streetcar  right-of-way 
west of theForest Dale  neighborhood 
ofSugar House , and then intersects 
2100 South (formerUS-40  and US-40A). 
Between 2100 South andLiberty Park 
, the road passes 
through mainly residential areas and includes bicycle lanes despite its 
formidable width and heavy traffic. SR-71 passes along the eastern edge of 
Liberty Park, which extends from 1300 South to 900 South. At 900 South the road 
narrows to approximately its original (generous) widthlaid out by Brigham Young 
 and then passes Trolley 
Square  (600 South to 500 South) 
before terminating atSR-186  (400 
South), which has theUTA TRAX Red Line 
 in its median, near the Gilgal 
Sculpture Garden . 700 
East continues north as a wide (but not state-maintained) road as far asSouth 
Temple .



 Future

The east-west portion of SR-71 in Riverton and Draper is being studied as a 
route for future public transportation improvements due to its route connecting
the current UTA TRAX red line terminus in Daybreak 
 to the 
under-constructionblue line terminus station in Draper 
 via a planned 
FrontRunner South  station in 
western Draper.
