Route description

The route begins at the interchange with I-84 
 just west of Mountain Green 
 in Morgan County 
, and travels east for about 
1.5 miles (2.4 km), roughly parallel to I-84. At this point, the route makes a 
turn to the north, becoming Trappers Loop Road, which begins to climb into the 
mountains separatingWeber Canyon  and
Ogden Valley 
 
(the top ofOgden Canyon ).

After climbing for 5.5 miles (8.9 km) and peaking at 6,000 feet (1,800 m) in 
elevation, the route crosses intoWeber County 
 and passes SR-226 
, the primary access road for 
Snowbasin  ski resort 
. From here, the route winds its way 
back downhill, to the north, making its way towards the Ogden Valley area. Just 
before the route enters the valley nearHuntsville 
, it exits the 
Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest 
 (the entire 
southern portion of the route lies in the national forest). The route then 
terminates at the intersection withSR-39 
, just south of Pineview Reservoir 
.
