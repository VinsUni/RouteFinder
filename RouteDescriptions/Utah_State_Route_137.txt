Route description

State Route 137 is configured as a loop of US-89, 
 
with a short southern spur to service the center of Mayfield. 
 It 
begins in Gunnison as 600 S at its intersection with Main Street (US-89), and 
travels eastward, turning southeast towards Mayfield as it passes the end of a 
mountain range. 
 At 
about the 7-mile (11 km) mark, as the route enters Mayfield's town limits, the 
southern spur splits off and travels south along Main Street for about 0.5 
miles (0.80 km). 
 The 
main leg of the route turns north on State Street and continues the 3.7 miles 
(6.0 km) north to its terminus at US-89.
