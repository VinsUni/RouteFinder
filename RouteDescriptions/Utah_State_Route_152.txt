Route description

SR-152 begins at the four-way intersection of Van Winkle Expressway and 900 
East just south ofBig Cottonwood Creek 
 (SR-71 
 turns west from 900 East onto Van 
Winkle Expressway, which defaults onto 700 East). Immediately to the east, 
there is an unsignalized three-way intersection (at which SR-152 traffic does 
notstop ) with Murray-Holladay road 
(formerSR-174 ), 
which heads straight east (SR-71 intersects the western portion of former 
SR-174 just west of SR-152's starting point). From there, SR-152 heads 
southeast as a four-lane divided highway with limited at-grade access through 
an undeveloped, low-lying, and wooded strip of land. For a short distance in 
this area, the road forms the border between Murray andMillcreek Township 
, but south of that, SR-152 is 
always the border between Murray and Holladay. Past an intersection at the 
terminus of formerSR-181 
 (1300 East), 
the route dips south-southeast to intersect with 5600 South nearCottonwood High 
School  and a small 
commercial area. The route once again veers to the southeast before crossing the
Jordan and Salt Lake Canal 

 in a low-density residential area (includinghorse properties 
). Upon reaching the 
intersection withVine Street 
 (former SR-173) and 
6100 South (a very short street connecting to the northern section of Highland 
Drive), the Van Winkle Expressway enters a commercial area and soon turns into 
(the southern section of) Highland Drive; a short one-way segment of Highland 
Drive provides an alternate route between the (much wider) northern and 
southern segments of that street for northbound vehicles. South of the 6100 
South intersection, SR-152 has six lanes and sidewalks and looses its wide 
unpaved median in favor of a center turn lane. The route terminates 
seven-tenths of a mile later 
 at an 
interchange withI-215 .
