Route description

Commencing from the route's western terminus in northern Saratoga Springs, 
SR-145 heads east as Pioneer Crossing with two lanes in each direction, divided 
by a center turn lane. After crossing over theJordan River 
, the route takes a brief 
northeasterly turn before returning due east. The route passes through a rural 
area of western Utah County before entering a stretch of development past 2300 
West. The highway turns southeast to avoid development before again turning 
northeast and east. The road gains a third lane in each direction past 300 East 
(on Lehi's grid) then becomes American Fork Main Street just prior to where it 
meets I-15 at adiverging diamond interchange 
 (DDI). The road 
continues east for about a half-mile and ends at an intersection with State 
Street (US-89).
