Route description

Located entirely in Salt Lake County, Utah 
, SR-202 begins at an 
intersection with SR-201 and 11500 West northwest ofMagna, Utah 
. The road travels northwesterly, 
bordered on the east by a largetailing pond 
 owned by Kennecott Utah Copper 
 and part of the former 
Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad 
 rail line,
  
which is now owned by theUnion Pacific Railroad 
 (UP). The parallel rail 
line intersects a pair of east–west rail lines, the southern line being UP main 
line, and the northern line being theFeather River Route 
 of the former Western 
Pacific Railroad , which 
is now owned by UP. 

 After crossing the rail lines, SR-202 intersects with I-80 near theGreat Salt 
Lake State Park  and 
comes to a terminus at the I-80 frontage road, which provides access to the 
Great Salt Lake State Park and to theSaltair 
 resort. 
 Kennecott 
Utah Copper owns all of the land surrounding SR-202, except for theright-of-way 
 for the railroad, 
and the highway itself. 


SR-202 serves as the eastbound ramp from SR-201 onto Interstate I-80, because 
at its intersection with I-80, the SR-201 (which is the southern terminus of 
SR-202) traffic only has the option to continue on I-80 westbound, and does not 
have an offramp to eastbound I-80. 
 
Traffic on SR-202 has increased 12% between 2002 and 2007, with adaily average 
 of 735 cars per day 
using SR-202 in 2007, 
 
compared to 475 cars per day in 2002. 
 Half 
of the traffic on SR-202 consists of buses and trucks.
