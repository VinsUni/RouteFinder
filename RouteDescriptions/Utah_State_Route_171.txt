Route description

From SR-111  in Magna, the 
highway (known as 3500 South) runs due east with between one and four 
general-purpose lanes in each direction until its junction withSR-68 
, where it veers to the 
northeast before again straightening out to the east. Other than the west end, 
this portion is entirely withinWest Valley City 
. The route passes through 
the former towns (now neighborhoods) of Hunter and Granger as well as West 
Valley City's modern downtown area near I-215 (which overlaps with historic 
Granger). The intersection withSR-154 
 was the first Continuous 
flow intersection  
built in Utah. At the intersection with 2700 West just west of I-215, the route 
crossesUTA TRAX Green Line  
light rail tracks near their terminus at theWest Valley Intermodal Hub 
. Between about SR-154 
and Market Street (near 2700 West and I-215), dedicated bus lanes forUTA 
's bus rapid transit 
service  run in the median.

East of SR-68 and the curve where it becomes 3300 South, SR-171 continues due 
east with two to three lanes in each direction, passing throughSouth Salt Lake 
 and Millcreek Township 
 (and very small segments near 
formerSR-181  
bordering Salt Lake City), until its terminus. It is the first road south of
2100 South  that provides 
access, for travelers from the west, toI-15 
 or other points east of the Union 
Pacific -UTA FrontRunner 
 railroad right-of-way; other 
roads in the area are blocked byUnion Pacific 
's Roper rail yard 
. About two blocks east of the 
bridges carrying the Union Pacific railroad, FrontRunner railroad, and I-15 
over the route, there is also agrade crossing 
 with TRAX 
's Blue 
 and Red 
 lines next to Millcreek 
station . Just before 
reaching former SR-181, SR-171 becomes much steeper than at any point to the 
west (other than when it ducks under the Union Pacific-FrontRunner 
right-of-way), and from there it continues to climb theEast Bench 

 foothills until its terminus.
